# Team Data
Each json files corresponds to a different group and it is crucial that each group adds their weight data for each part separately in order to give the most accurate stability calculations. This can be done by adding/removing inputs until each component has been specified. 

The mass is measured in kilograms and the position is the distance in meters from the tip of the nose cone to the centre of gravity of the component. THIS WILL BE CHANGED to centre of gravity of component to top of component.
